                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I am a computer science major currently attending California State University of Fullerton.
                    I tend to find myself starting projects that I believe that are both fun, useful, and in places where I learn a lot about a new area.
                    Coding definitely has its challenging moments and the satisfication of accomplishing and overcoming difficult problems always has me appreciating the beauty in coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day, it's the programmer not the computer right? As you take a look at my personal website, I hope you learn more about me! 
                    Thank you for taking the time to come to my website and feel free to contact me at anytime!
                </p>
