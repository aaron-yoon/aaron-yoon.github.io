                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I am a computer science major currently attending California State University of Fullerton.
                    I tend to find myself starting projects that I believe that are both fun and beneficial to my coding career.
                    Coding definitely has its challenging moments and the satisfication of accomplishing and overcoming difficult 
                    problems always ignites my passion to move on to the next challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, you'll find me working on projects that involve cloud computing and storage, and exploring the use cases of algorithms.  
                    As you take a look at my personal website, I hope you learn more about me! 
                    Thank you for taking the time to come to my website and feel free to contact me at anytime!
                </p>
